# Popup Panel Differences

For the classic popup panel, Nano Adblocker has a dedicated button for toggling
the firewall (sometimes called overview) panel, and the labels do not respond
to clicks. Also, the refresh button is always shown.

For the new popup panel, Nano Adblocker only allows showing and hiding the
firewall panel, other sections are always shown.
