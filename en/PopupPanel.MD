# Popup Panel Differences

For the classic popup panel, Nano Adblocker has a dedicated button for toggling
the firewall (sometimes called overview) panel, and the headings do not respond
to clicks.

For the new popup panel, Nano Adblocker by default only allows showing and
hiding the top toolbar and the firewall panel, other sections are always shown.
However, this default behavior can be changed in the advanced settings.

In both cass, the refresh button is always shown.
